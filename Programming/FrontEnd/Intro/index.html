<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p>My name is Maggie and I'm 23. I'm a computer science student living in Sydney. I grew up in the sunshine state (also known as Queensland) where there is plenty of sun, farmers markets and awesome biking routes. My interests lie in iOS development and my favorite programming language is of course, Swift! On the weekends, you'll most likely find me sipping on a soy chai at a quiet cafe with a good book. </p>

<h2>Home Town</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane">Brisbane</a> is the capital of Queensland. The Brisbane River is absolutely breathtaking and you can catch the <em>CityCat</em> ferry to get from one side of the river to the other.  </p>
